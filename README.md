# Problem Solving in the Days of War and Disconnection

During the days when the internet was cut off in Iran due to the Iran–Israel war and only domestic websites were accessible, I turned to the two things that help quiet my mind: problem solving and music.

This repository is the result of the first one.

It contains a collection of Python files — each one solving a different problem from the Iranian platform [Quera](https://quera.org) — written during those days of war, stress, and deep concern for my friends and family.


تا قهر را برهم زند آن لطف اندر لطف تو

تا صلح گیرد هر طرف، تا محو گردد جنگ‌ها

-مولانا

## Contents

Each `.py` file in this repository corresponds to a specific problem from Quera.  
At the top of each file, you can find a comment like this:

```python
# This is an answer to this Quera question
# https://quera.org/problemset/...
```
You can click the link to view the original problem (if accessible), and run the Python script locally to see the solution in action.
